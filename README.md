# Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) Practice

This repository contains my **solutions to various Data Structures and Algorithms problems**. Each problem includes:

- **Problem Statement**  
- **Examples**  
- **Solution Approach** (where I explain my thinking, strategy, and any challenges I encountered)  
- **Working Code** (primarily in Java, but occasionally in Python)  

The problems are organized by **topic/** for easier navigation.
Each topic directory contains Markdown files for individual problems.
